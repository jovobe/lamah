LaMah ü¶ôÔ∏è ‚Äì A language for the Game Boy
======================================

This is merely a hobby project of ours and is therefore highly experimental.
Our goal is just to design our own language and build a compiler.
Feel free to check out the code or try it for yourself.

## Building and Running

You need a somewhat recent version of Rust and Cargo to compile this project.

## Documentation and Information

There is some information and a couple of links [in the wiki](https://github.com/jovobe/lamah/wiki).
